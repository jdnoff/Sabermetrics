This program uses data from the Retrosheet play-by-play data for every regular season baseball game from 2005-2015 and calculates both
standard and advanced stats to attempt to understand the overall effectiveness of the hit-and-run play. 

The analysis of the derived data can be found in the included .pdf report. 

Note: The .csv data file I used was way too large to include in the repository, won't run properly without it.
